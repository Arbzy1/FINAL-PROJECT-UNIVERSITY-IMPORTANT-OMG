# Top School Recognition Feature

## Overview

The Top School Recognition Feature enhances the location recommendation system by identifying and highlighting high-performing schools in Cardiff. This feature provides users with at-a-glance information about school quality that can significantly impact housing decisions, especially for families with children.

## Implementation Details

### Data Source

The feature uses a comprehensive list of all 18 mainstream state secondary schools in Cardiff, ranked based on:
- Estyn inspection ratings (Wales' education authority)
- GCSE examination results and performance data
- Academic outcomes (percentage of pupils earning 5+ GCSEs A*-C including English/Welsh and Math)
- Community reputation and parent feedback

This data compilation draws from official Estyn inspection reports, Welsh Government exam statistics, Cardiff Council news releases, and community reviews.

### Technical Implementation

1. **Data Storage**: The complete school rankings data is stored in `top_schools.json` with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "School Name": { 
       "rating": "Excellent|Good|Adequate", 
       "rank": 1-18, 
       "postcode": "CF23 6WG" 
     },
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Backend Processing**: During amenity analysis, the system compares each identified school with the ranked list:
   ```python
   if a_type == "school" and nearest.get("name") in top_schools_dict:
       amenity_data["is_top_rated"] = True
       amenity_data["rank"] = school_info["rank"]
       amenity_data["rating"] = school_info["rating"]
   ```

3. **Frontend Display**:
   - Top schools receive a visual badge with tier-based indicators:
     - ðŸ¥‡ Top 3 Schools (Ranks 1-3)
     - ðŸ¥ˆ Top 10 Schools (Ranks 4-10)
     - ðŸŒŸ Ranked Schools (Ranks 11-18)
   - The badge displays in:
     - Location results cards
     - Interactive map popups
     - Amenity breakdowns
   - Estyn ratings ("Excellent", "Good", or "Adequate") are also displayed for additional context

## User Benefits

This feature:
- Provides trusted context for school quality at-a-glance
- Helps users understand the educational landscape across Cardiff
- Eliminates the need for separate research about school performance
- Addresses a key concern in housing decisions that mainstream property sites don't handle well
- Gives users actionable information that impacts decision-making, particularly for families
- Includes both English-medium and Welsh-medium schools for comprehensive coverage

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to this feature could include:
- Extending to primary schools
- Adding school catchment area visualization (critical for Cardiff's school allocation system)
- Including additional metrics like:
  - School admission numbers and oversubscription rates
  - Subject specialties and sixth form offerings
  - Free School Meal (FSM) percentages for socioeconomic context
  - Distance-based school admission likelihood estimations
- Expanding to other UK cities with appropriately sourced data
